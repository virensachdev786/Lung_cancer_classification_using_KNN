# Lung_cancer_classification_using_KNN
Modified the LUNG Cancer Data Set and use the kNN Algorithm. Ran the algorithm 1000 times for each value of k=1,2,3,...,20. 
For each value of k find the mean test and training accuracy. Plot these two mean accuracy rates vs k on a single plot. 

Implemented KNN algorithm using scikitlearn, pandas, and NumPy to classify lung cancer patients using a lung cancer dataset. 
Cleaned and normalized dataset. Accomplished mean accuracy of 82%.
